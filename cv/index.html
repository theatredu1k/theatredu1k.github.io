	<h1>Sabrina Recoules Quang , Puppeteer , Coder and Researcher in Smart textile</h1>
<p>Vietnamese, born in France, I am currently researching Smart textile for puppetry purpose at the Royal college of Arts after achieving an MFA in computational art at Goldsmiths. </p>
<p>Alongside making and performing in puppetry and shadow theatre for five years, I have shaped my improvisation practice in London and Berlin with LISPA and performed and exhibited in London, Berlin, Paris and Malta.</p>
Introspections or interactions, my installations made of wood, paper, automata and found objects invite the audience to an emotional and playful response. In my imaginary worlds, animated projections and recorded voices share their memories when shadows, puppets and masks reveal the truth.
