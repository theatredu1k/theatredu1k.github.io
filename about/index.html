	<p>Since 2016, I have been extending my puppetry expression with technology</p>
	<p>coding interactive intefaces with computer vision ("Look at the Other")</p>
	<p>,embedding electronics in sound reactive textile artefacts( "DadaAutomata")>

	<p class="ex1">The humans look like torrent cucumbers </p>
	<p class="ex1">The triangles will read their consequential A P I  </p>
	<p class="ex1">In the CRT displays, life is a series of repeatable things</p>
	<p class="ex1">The things are grateful</p>
